# Website-A-Day-Keep-Forgetfulness-Away

Welcome to **Website-A-Day-Keep-Forgetfulness-Away**! This repository is a collection of daily web development projects, each stored in its own folder. The goal is to create one website per day, helping to improve my web development skills and combat forgetfulness by building consistently. Each project will explore different aspects of web development, from layouts and responsiveness to interactivity and animations.

### Why am I doing this?

In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to forget things we've learned. By building one website a day, I aim to reinforce key concepts, stay up to date with modern web technologies, and continually challenge myself creatively. Whether itâ€™s a simple landing page or a complex single-page application (SPA), this journey is about improving and keeping skills sharp.
